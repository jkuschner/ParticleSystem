### Working with `.skel` and other asset files
Xcode manages the compiled program for you. The working directory for the program when running inside xcode is not the project directory. However, you can put files in the `assets` folder as it will be copied to the working directory during build time. For asset files, put it inside the `assets` folder and access the file with path `"assets/FILE_NAME_HERE.EXTENSION"`.

Similarily, you can put shader files in `shaders` and access them with path `"shaders/FILE_NAME_HERE.EXTENSION"`.
